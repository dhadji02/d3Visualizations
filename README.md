# MVIS_FinalProject
## Name
Final MVIS Project - Rising Star - Dolmadakia Team 2022-2023

## Description
This project was created in the context of the Final Project of the INFOMVIS - Meaningful Visualization course of Utrecht University during the academic year 2022-2023. The website is called Rising Star and it tries to reach an audience that consists of new upcoming artists, that try to get information about music keys, popular genres and possible release dates and months for their songs. The dataset used comes from Spotify and contains several info for songs from 1929 until 2022. The dataset was derived from Kaggle. 5 different visualizations can be found on the website that were created according to design principles we learned during the course INFOMVIS. The technologies used for the development of the project were HTML, CSS, Javascript, D3 and Bootstrap. 

## Installation
In order for d3 to run, it needs to be on a local host or another server so that the libraries can run smoothly. When there is a host up for the page to run on, the index.html is the starting point for the website. 

## Usage
On the website there are 5 visualizations on the website that are generated via user interaction. The visualizations are presented in different tabs per category. The three tabs are: What genre should I choose?, What key should I use?, Best Release Month/Day. The content per tabs is described below:
1. What genre should I choose? - A line chart where the users select what genres (up to 3) will be compared according to popularity (presented for 1929 - 2022)
2. What key should I use? - A histogram that presents the popularity of the music keys of the 100 top songs of all time for a specific selected genre
3. Best Release Month/Day - A line chart that presents according to a selected genre, the trend of the popularity of the genre for each month.
4. Best Release Month/Day - A line chart that is generated according to the selection of the month on the x-axis from the (3) line chart, to show the popularity for that genre for the days of the week 
5. Best Release Month/Day - A heatmap that is generated to demonstrate the same result as (4)
On the website there is an "About Us" page as well, that contains photos and information about the Authors of the project. Also, the user can find some info about the dataset.
